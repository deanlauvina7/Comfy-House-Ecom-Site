## Welcome! 

Thanks for checking out my Comfy House Ecom Project.

## The project

My goal for this project was to build out a landing page that's similar to what you would find on most ecommerce websites.

My main objective was to create a functioning cart that updates the total price in real time of when items are added to, remove items, and change the quantity of an item. I also utlize some local storage so that if a customer wanted to exit from the screen and then come back later, their cart would still have the items they selected.

## Tools I used 
HTML, CSS, Javascript, local storage

## Giving feedback
